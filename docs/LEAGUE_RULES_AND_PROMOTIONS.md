# League Rules and Promotions Guide

## 📋 Season Closure Rules

### Overview
When a season ends, the system automatically calculates promotions, relegations, and stays based on final player positions in their groups.

### General Rules

**Group Structure:**
- Groups always have minimum 8 players
- Groups are ordered hierarchically (Group 1 is top, Group 8 is bottom, etc.)

**Promotion/Relegation Logic:**

| Group Type | Promotions | Relegations |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Top Group (1)** | None (already highest) | 2 players (positions 7-8) → Group 2 |
| **Middle Groups (2-7)** | 2 players (positions 1-2) → Group above | 2 players (positions 7-8) → Group below |
| **Bottom Group** | 2 players (positions 1-2) → Group above | None (no lower group) |

**Additional Relegations (Groups >8):**
- If a group has >8 players, extra relegations apply:
  - `total_relegations = 2 + (group_size - 8)`
  - Example: 10-player group → 2 + (10 - 8) = **4 relegations**

**Tie-Breaking Rules** (when players are tied on position):
1. **Head-to-head** (only 2 players)
2. **Mini-league** (3+ players): internal matches between tied players
3. **Internal averages**: set difference in mini-league
4. **Global averages**: total set difference in group
5. **Alphabetical order** (last resort)

## 🎯 Complete Promotion/Demotion Workflow

### Step 1: Finish the Season
1. Go to **http://localhost:4173/admin/seasons**
2. Verify season end date is in the past
3. **"Movimientos"** (Movements) button should be active (dark orange)

### Step 2: View Promotion Proposal
1. Click **"Movimientos"** button
2. Page opens: **http://localhost:4173/admin/seasons/{seasonId}/proposals**

On this page you'll see:

**Statistical Summary:**
- **Total Players**: Players in season
- **Promotions 📈**: Players moving up
- **Relegations 📉**: Players moving down
- **Stays ➡️**: Players staying in group

**Details by Group:**
- `#N` = Final position (1 is first place)
- Player name
- `🏆 X` = Wins count
- Movement selector dropdown

### Step 3: Edit Movements (Optional)
1. Click movement dropdown for any player
2. Choose:
   - **Mantiene ➡️** = Stays in same group
   - **Asciende 📈** = Moves up one group
   - **Desciende 📉** = Moves down one group
3. Click **"Guardar Cambios"** when done

**Default Rules** (auto-applied if unchanged):
- **Top 2** of each group promoted (except top group)
- **Bottom 2** of each group relegated (except bottom group)
- **All others** stay in current group

### Step 4: Approve Proposal
1. Review all movements
2. Click **"Aprobar Propuesta"** (Approve Proposal)
3. Confirm: "This will apply movements..."

**On approval:**
- ✅ Movements registered in player history

### Step 5: Generate Next Season
After approval, button changes to **"Generar Siguiente Temporada"** (Generate Next Season)

1. Click **"Generar Siguiente Temporada"**
2. Confirm: "Generate next season importing these players?"

**Automatically creates:**
- ✅ New season (dates +3 months forward)
- ✅ Cloned groups with same names
- ✅ Players reassigned based on movements:
   - Promotions → Higher group
   - Relegations → Lower group
   - Stays → Same group
- ✅ Ready for new season

## 📊 Example Scenario

**Current Season Status:**
```
Group A (Top):
  1. Juan   → 8 wins

  2. Eva    → 8 wins (PROMOTE to Group A)
  3. Tom    → 4 wins
  4. Mar    → 3 wins (RELEGATE to Group C)
```

**After Clicking "Movimientos":**

```
